### What is Clockwork?

Clockwork is a browser extension, providing tools for debugging and profiling your PHP applications, including request data, application log, database queries, routes, visualisation of application runtime and more.

Clockwork uses a server-side component, that gathers all the data and easily integrates with any PHP project, including out-of-the-box support for major frameworks.

Read more and try it out on the [Clockwork website](https://underground.works/clockwork).

*This repository contains the Clockwork Chrome extension.*
